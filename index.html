      <article>Alaska is known for being home to some of the most amazing hikes in the country. Most of the state is still untouched by development and you can get up close and personal with nature just about anywhere! Not only are the views breathtaking, but the wildlife - from moose to bears - reminds you that this is truly the Last Frontier!

          <h2>Flattop Mountain</h2>
          <p class="story">
            Just outside of Anchorage, Alaska is <a href="http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/maps/flattopmountaintrailguide.pdf">Flattop Montain</a>. Being only a few miles from town, it offers amazing views of the skyline and Cook Inlet. Reaching the top of the mountain rewuires some bouldering and is not and easy task, but the view from the summit is worth it and you!
